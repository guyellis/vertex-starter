# Results Folder

The output from each vertex "run" will be saved in this folder in a time-stamped file.

Files ending in `-raw.txt` will have both the input and the output. This is useful because we often tinker with parameters and prompt and it is difficult to remember what input gave us each result.

Files ending in `-content.txt` contain the result from the call which is also in the previous file but should provide a more convenient, easier to read and formatted result.
